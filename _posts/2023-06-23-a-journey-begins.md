> The following is a summary of my hard, but rewarding journey to become an AI/ML researcher in form of a short story. Sharing this story with you is a starting point of my blogging journey to talk about what I've learnt and show that if you have a dream, no matter how challenging or unreachable it may seem, you can make it happen. Have tested it and it works, believe me! ;)

Hello World! A phrase that reverberates through the halls of programming, 
echoing the humble beginnings of countless digital voyagers. It serves as a beacon, 
a declaration of initiation into a world of infinite possibilities. 
And so, with a nod to tradition and a touch of whimsy, I extend a warm "Hello World!" to you, 
fellow tech enthusiasts, adventurers of the digital realm, and seekers of knowledge. 
Today, together, we embark on a captivating odyssey, an exploration into the realms of 
technology, programming, and the ever-evolving landscape of innovation. 
Allow me to introduce myself and share my fervent love for all things tech as we venture 
forth into this exhilarating journey.

## The Birth of Curiosity
It all began with a spark, ignited in the depths of my soul, 
as I discovered the mesmerising realm of technology. 
From a young age, the allure of computers and their endless possibilities fascinated me. 
Like a kid in a candy store, I eagerly delved into the intricacies of gaming, relishing in 
the immersive worlds and marveling at the intricate code behind them. 
Little did I know, these early experiences would pave the way for a lifelong passion.

## Nurturing the Flame
As the years went by, my love for technology only grew stronger. After graduating from high school, I found myself at a crossroads, trying to navigate the uncertain waters of choosing a field of study. Considering the circumstances at the time, I made the decision to pursue a bachelor’s degree in business management. While this path held its own allure, my heart yearned for the world of tech and computers.
Determined to quench my thirst for technological knowledge, I embarked on a parallel journey. Evenings and weekends became my sanctuary, where I delved into the realms of web development. Armed with determination and an unyielding passion, I began teaching myself the intricacies of coding, starting with web technologies.
With each line of code I crafted, a sense of fulfilment washed over me. I built small projects, experimenting with different frameworks and designs, and witnessed the transformative power of bringing ideas to life through programming. Despite the constraints imposed by my business management studies, I persevered, determined to push the boundaries of my self-taught knowledge.
However, it was clear that a deeper immersion in the world of technology was necessary for me to truly thrive. Graduating from my business management program opened a new chapter in my journey — one where I could wholeheartedly pursue my passion. With the conviction that technology was my calling, I dived headfirst into JavaScript, honing my skills and expanding my understanding.


## Charting New Horizon
> From Web Development to Machine Learning

As my proficiency in JavaScript grew, so did my dreams. It became increasingly evident that my future lay in the fascinating field of machine learning. The potential to create intelligent systems that could learn, adapt, and revolutionise the way we perceive the world around us captured my imagination. The decision to pursue a master's degree in machine learning became not just a logical step but a leap of faith into uncharted territories.
And so, my journey continued, transitioning from the shores of web development to the vast ocean of machine learning. It was a daunting yet exhilarating transition, where the power of algorithms and data merged into an amalgamation of possibility. The knowledge I had gained during my self-directed studies laid the foundation for this new phase, propelling me forward with a hunger for deeper understanding.
But even as I embarked on this advanced educational pursuit, I carried with me the lessons learned from my humble beginnings. The experiences of navigating a different field, juggling management studies with my tech aspirations, and persistently self-teaching web development instilled in me a resilience that would prove invaluable in the years to come.
It is within this context that my master's degree in machine learning became not just an academic milestone, but a culmination of a lifelong passion. The decision to venture into research and explore the frontiers of AI was a natural progression, blending my love for technology with an insatiable desire to contribute to the field's growth.


## Forging the Future
As I reflect upon the journey thus far, it becomes clear that the seemingly divergent paths I traversed - business management and self-taught web development - were essential in shaping the technologist I am today. They instilled in me a multidimensional perspective, enabling me to understand not just the intricacies of technology but also its application in the wider world.
With each step forward, I continue to learn, grow, and evolve. The pursuit of knowledge and the thrill of discovery remain constant companions, propelling me towards new horizons. And now, as I eagerly await the outcome of my Ph.D. application, I stand at the threshold of the next chapter - ready to document, share, and inspire through the power of blogging.
Stay tuned, dear reader, for more tales from the realm of technology, personal projects, research insights, and a world where lines of code have the power to shape our future. Together, let us embark on this odyssey, unraveling the mysteries and embracing the wonders that lie ahead.
As I conclude this introduction, dear reader, I hope you find yourself inspired by the journey that has brought me to this point. From humble beginnings to the pursuit of higher education, my story is a testament to the transformative power of following one's passions. Join me as we embark on this shared adventure, united by our love for technology and the boundless potential it holds. Together, let us unlock new frontiers and create a brighter future through the magic of programming and innovation.
