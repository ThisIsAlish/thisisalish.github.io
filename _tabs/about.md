## Just a Regular Dude Who Loves Learning and Tinkering!

I studied Business Management and really enjoyed the entrepreneurial perspective. I even tried to enter the market with small startup ideas, which unfortunately ended in failure (obviously!). The main problem was that I lacked the technical skills to:

Understand exactly what I wanted
Effectively communicate my ideas to technical people
After trying and failing, I decided to shift gears. Since there wasn't anything else I wanted to do, I started learning web development as a relatively easier entry point into the vast world of programming and computer science.

While learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I realized I needed more. I began searching for graduate degrees at top universities and found the perfect fit: a Masterâ€™s in Machine Learning!

With great excitement, I began my Master's in Machine Learning, despite having no prior programming background (apart from a bit of web development, which wasn't enough!). Although it was very challenging at times, I was incredibly happy during my studies. I met many bright minds and top professors, learning a lot from them, and I made great friends from all around the world!

During my Master's, I started working as a programming tutor and discovered my passion for helping others learn. Since then, I've continued tutoring and thoroughly enjoy it. Now, I'm pursuing a PhD, with my research focusing on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

A couple of my friends suggested I start writing about what I've learned, and they gave me the courage to do it. So, I created this blog to share my personal experiences, programming concepts, AI ideas, and small home projects.

Welcome to my blog! ;)
